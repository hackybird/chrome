### FAQ :

Q : How can I get rid of promoted tweets ?    
A : Use an ad blocker like "ublock origin". 

Q : Can I assign a keyboard shortcut to sort ?     
A : Yes. Visit chrome://extensions/ . Scroll to bottom (right) or search for "Keyboard shortcuts". Click & assign.

Q : Do I need to signup or authorize with my twitter account ?    
A : No. Just open your twitter timeline or search anything on twitter or go to any user's feed & click the extension to sort. 

Q : Are my settings sync'd in the cloud or with my google account ?     
A : No. All settings are saved in your browser's local storage. 

Q : How do I unhide the tweets (that were marked as read)     
A : Either reload the page OR uncheck the "Mark as read" option 

Q : What is "user weight" ?      
A : Higher weight => tweets & retweets from the user would be shown higher up. 
    Default is 1. Any other value is multiplied to the count of retweets & likes. 
    So a user weight of 1.5 with 100 retweets & 20 likes has a score = 1.5 x (100 + 20)

Q : How do I change the "user weight" ?     
A : After you've sorted your timeline (i.e. clicked on the extension), you can simply hover over the username of either the tweeter or the retweeter. 
    A small floating box will show up with either the default weight (i.e. 1) or whatever value you've stored in the past. 
    Just enter a new value & you should be done. 

Q : What is "Normalize" in options ?      
A : If checked, the count of retweets & likes is divided by the age of the tweet (in seconds). Otherwise absolute count is used.

Q : What's the slider next to Retweets / likes in options ?    
A : It shows the % contribution of the count of retweets & likes that'll be used for sorting. 
    Example : 100% retweets & 0% likes => Only sort based on retweet count

Q : Is the extension safe to use ?    
A : Yes. All your data is stored locally on your computer. Nothing is uploaded to the cloud. It only re-arranges your timeline & only when you explicitly click the extension. Just reload the page to ignore the extension.
